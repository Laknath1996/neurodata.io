            content: |
              NIH MN-19-147
              Role on project: Principal Investigator
              Term: 01-Mar-2020 to 30-June-2023
              Budget: $861,240 (direct) $549,039 (indirect) $1,410,279 (total)
              The goal of this project is to establish a state-of-the-art toolbox for analysis of connectomes, spanning taxa, scale, and complexity. More specifically, we will develop and extend implementations to enable neurobiologists to 1) estimate latent structure from attributed connectomes, (2) identify meaningful clusters among populations of connectomes, and (3) detect relationships between connectomes and multivariate phenotypes, such as behavior, genetics, and physiology.
